<p>I have had extensive experience with manipulating and analyzing public program data. My graduate research involved identifying socio-economic and systematic factors associated with health care disparities. That research further fueled my passion for data-driven operations and program evaluation. Subsequently, I pursued a career in the non-profit health care sector where I leveraged data, technology, and statistical models to increase the efficiency and impact of my agency's services. It has been fulfilling to help clinical directors and executive leaders adapt to the increasing needs of underserved communities in the face of limited resources and staffing.</p>

<p>I have successfully completed projects throughout the data lifecycle and demonstrated analytical and communication skills in:</p>
<ol>
	<li>identifying and solving issues in the collection, entry, organization, and cleaning of raw data.</li>
	<li>utilizing the appropriate data analysis tools and methods.</li>
	<li>disseminating meaningful findings with end users.</li>
	<li>working on feedback in a timely manner.</li>
</ol>
